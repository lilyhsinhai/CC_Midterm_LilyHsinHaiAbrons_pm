- [x] make square (bright orange)
	- [x] make curved line for the path of the square (similar color)
	- [x] put the curved line in a class with variables for the vertices and pull points
	- [x] arrange square to be on the line
	- [x] get the curve to be continuous across the whole sketch
	- [x] get square to follow the path of the line
- [x] make circle (green)
	- [x] make curved line (different from square line) for the path of the circle (similar color) using my class
	- [x] arrange circle to be on the line
	- [x] get circle to follow the path of the line
- [x] make triangle (blue)
	- [x] make curved line (different from square and circel lines) for the path of the triangle (similar color) using my class
	- [x] arrange triangle to be on the line
	- [x] get triangle to follow the path of the line

- [x] make shapes bounce back and forth on their lines
- [ ] make it 3D
	- [ ] make shapes 3D
	- [ ] make wires 3D
- [ ] use the z plane to make the wires "come at u"
- [x] click on space bar to pause and unpause the shapes
- [ ] click on shapes with mouse to change shape and randomize color
- [ ] adjust speed
- [ ] drag mouse to adjust wires
- [x] have shapes move at different speeds on different wires
- [ ] multiple shapes per wire (different speeds)


**Must Haves**
- [x] heavy use of variables
- [x] custom functions passing variables as parameter 
- [ ] loops 
- [x] control structures 
- [ ] math or random 
- [ ] some use of interaction or change over time 
- [x] movement, change, variety 
- [ ] arrays
- [x] conditionals
